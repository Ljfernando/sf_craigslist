One of the rooms in my 2 BR Apartment is opening up and I'm looking to fill it ASAP. 
A little about the area:
- The apartment is located in the heart of Cow Hollow, specifically in between Laguna St. and Buchanan St. We are the top apartment so no noise above the apartment. The Urban Remedy juice shop is below us.
- There's great restaurants and bars all around the apartment. Some of the most popular spots include Marengo, Italian Homemade and Perry's.
- Neighborhood bars and staples to the area are Bus Stop and Blue Light.
- Commuting to and from the apartment is super easy. Two public transportation options are SF MUNI (the bus) which picks you up ~20 steps to the right from our front door and Chariot ~20 steps to the left of the front door.
- The apartment is 5 minute walking distance to one of the most desirable views/parks in the entire city: Marina Green and Crissy Field. If you're active and like to get outside, this apartment is great for being able to do that.
A little about me:
- Easy going guy in my mid-late 20's. I've lived in this place for a while and appreciate keeping it tidy. I'm not a clean freak but air on the side of keeping things tidy and respectable for others.
- I enjoy watching sports on the weekends, Netflix etc. 
- I work at a health tech start up and lead our Business Development efforts for the past 4+ years. I travel quite a bit for work (~1 week per month).
- Looking for someone who is not bringing the party back from the bars but can enjoy the pros of living near that scene. Also pays rent on time, every month :)
Text/email me directly if you're seriously interested!

Sublease a beautiful room in the Haight for November-January (potentially longer) $1385 per month + utilities + $2025 security deposit.  
Live in a large and beautiful room with 3 bay windows. 
The Apartment: Victorian and pretty. It has all that great San Francisco detailing; wainscoting, hardwood floors, molding. 2nd floor unit in a 3 story building. 1 split bathroom. Free washer/dryer. Sun room. Back porch. Backyard. Decent sized kitchen with pantry. Big living room. An unbelievably large spice rack (our pride and joy). There is no garage available - street parking only. No pets allowed either, even though we love animals. 
The Hood: Broderick and Oak or Page (all depends on how you look at that sort of thing). It's super close to the Panhandle, Golden Gate Park, the Lower Haight, the Haight, Divis, Castro, Duboce Park, lots of bus lines, bike lanes, Falletti Foods, BiRite, restaurants, shops, the Independent, and a darling Sunday Farmer's Market. Really the best place to live in the city. The Roommates: There are 5 total spaces in the flat. Seems like a lot, but it never feels crowded and each of us has the whole place to ourselves quite often due to travel or work schedules. We are all pretty awesome. We can socialize over dinner, cooking in the kitchen, or all going out together. We're lots of fun, intelligent, goofy, and respectful of each other. We make an effort to keep the place clean and tidy. We want someone that fits into our mix and can be a part of what we already share.
Roommate 1 (32) - Roommate 1 is currently studying somatic therapy, and is also a product designer/maker who enjoys a wide variety of activities. He feels most at home in the great outdoors and enjoys rock climbing, yoga, naps, non-pretentious yet intelligent conversations, cooking, building and designing things with his 3D printer and laser cutter.
Roommate 2 (24) - Earthling who enjoys dancing, crafting, and hopelessly learning banjo. She is also an animal and nature lover who wants a clean and tidy home that is cozy and welcoming after a long day at work.
communication is key for any roommate to be!
Roommate 3 (29) - Is a wannabe chef (he always makes the kitchen smell amazing), and works in the medical field helping people get back to health and mobility. He practices yoga like a boss and is just one heck of a stand-up guy. 
Roommate 4 (24) - Is a Business Intelligence consultant, always learning new things and challenging himself to grow. He is truly an inspiration to be around - a gentleman and a scholar. 
Roomate 5 You?
Send us an email telling us a little about yourself. Go on, don't be shy. 
How old are you? 
We'd like to know how you spend your days,
how many days a week you would plan on being here,
what your favorite thing about San Francisco is, and really anything you think we should know about you.
When are you available to see the apartment (weeknights and weekends)?
We're looking forward to meeting you!

Short walk to USF, Golden Gate Park and Clement Street shops and restaurants.
This sunny 2 bedroom 1 bathroom unit is on the second floor of a well maintained three floor building and was recently vacated by three USF students.

The unit has double paned windows and is located at the front of the building for maximum sunshine.  It also features an extra large living room (see the pic).  One of the bedrooms has a large closet, see pic.  
The building is a short walk to USF and thus we do have some USF students residing in the building, but no wild parties and no pets.  No smoking.  The owners pays for garbage and water.   
The unit is rent controlled.
Clement Street restaurants and Safeway are a ten minute walk.

A spacious 1 bedroom, 1.5 bath at 1,187 square feet and a highly functional floor plan.  The main level consists of a remodeled kitchen, marble counters, half bathroom, and full walk-in closet.  Upstairs one will find a master bedroom, full bathroom, and a loft style office space. The apartment has all new appliances and washer/dryer inside the unit. 
 This building is designated as a landmark of historical significance.  Which also means it is located on bedrock and not landfill.  Re-habbed and retrofitted in 1996, this unit is a classic ""Brick and Timber"" loft with great style and architectural appeal.
The building is situated very well to restaurants, transit, and the downtown commercial district.  A short one block stroll and you will be on the Embarcadero where you will find a well-regarded Seafood restaurant and equally regarded steakhouse.  Across the street is a more casual dinning experience but the closest place to grab a meal.  If you walk another block down the Embarcadero towards the ferry building, you will find a fantastic neighborhood restaurant and bar.  And of course, there is always the Ferry Building itself, with multiple eateries and shops.  You are also a short stroll along the bay to AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team.
One block away on the Embarcadero is the Muni Tram system, which can take you to many places across the city.  A few blocks walk down Spear street toward Market street will take you to the Embarcadero BART station which can take you across the city and under the bay to east bay locations.

I'm going to sublet my apartment in the SF Mission District for up to a year. I'm going to live in the North Bay for awhile but plan to return to the City at some point after one year. 
Apartment will be available to move in anytime between December 1st and the first week in January. 
Written rental agreement would be month to month, but looking for people who plan to stay at least six months and up to a year.
Email me with your preferred time frame, thanks!
This is a top floor 3 to 4 bedroom apartment with 1 1/2 baths, that is suitable for up to 4 people living here. You can use the living room as a fourth bedroom if needed. All rooms have their own real walls/doors, no french doors or partitions. 
Living room/bedroom is large - 250 sq. ft.
There are two other large bedrooms - 156 sq. ft. and 144 sq. ft.
One smaller bedroom - 100 sq. ft., which also has a large walk in closet with shelves, 6 x 4 ft.
There is also a very large storage closet with shelves, drawers and clothing rack in the hallway - 13 x 4 ft.
The apartment can come semi-furnished if you would like, or I can clear it out completely. I have two beds that can stay (a twin and a queen), and possibly a third bed, and a bit of the furniture, such as IKEA wardrobes in two of the bedrooms, and some kitchen supplies.
The apartment is conveniently and centrally located in the Mission district, close to public transportation - BART and many Muni lines (14, 22, 49, 55, 33, J), as well as to Dolores Park, grocery shopping - Whole Foods, Bi Rite, Safeway, plus the shops, cafes, bars, restaurants on Valencia Street.
I keep a clean and quiet home and I'm looking for people who can maintain my home in this way while I'm away.

As the undisputed cultural heart of the city, the Mission has a progressive spirit that's constantly evolving and a soul that holds true to its historic Latino roots. Young, exciting, inventive, and flourishing--this is a community that's firing on all cylinders, and the energy is infectious. 1128 Valencia is perfectly located above a quaint  park-let setting between 22nd and 23rd Streets, at the core of the Mission's dynamic action and its trendy Valencia Street corridor--enabling residents walk to the hippest bars, restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues within seconds, or relax with friends at the bistro tables directly outside our front door.
The Mission also has the city's largest concentration of murals and street art, which proudly decorates buildings, fences, garage doors, alleys, and even the ground you're walking on. And let's not forget movies at the Roxie, live music at The Chapel, Amnesia, and Make Out Room, and theater at The Marsh or Brava Theater Center. There's never a shortage of things to explore--literally right outside your door.
The Mission's micro-climate tends to sit on the sunny side, boasting some of the best weather in the city. As a result, alfresco park-lets and biking abound, but people also flock to the grassy slopes of Dolores Park to catch some of the best views of the city.

The Mission also has the city's largest concentration of murals and street art, which proudly decorates buildings, fences, garage doors, alleys, and even the ground you're walking on. And let's not forget movies at the Roxie, live music at The Chapel, Amnesia, and Make Out Room, and theater at The Marsh or Brava Theater Center. There's never a shortage of things to explore--literally right outside your door.
The Mission's micro-climate tends to sit on the sunny side, boasting some of the best weather in the city. As a result, alfresco park-lets and biking abound, but people also flock to the grassy slopes of Dolores Park to catch some of the best views of the city.

If you're moving to the Bay Area for a limited period, or long-term but not had time to find your permanent home, this is a great option.  As long as you see this posting, my apartment is available as I will delete it as soon as it is rented. TEXT me, Martin, at  show contact info
 to view it by appointment.  
THE APARTMENT -  New apartment, almost 1000 sq ft on the ground floor of my 2-story house: one bedroom and a full-size living room (which can be a 2nd bedroom but is the only door to garden), a dining area, den/study/or office, a second computer nook, a fully-modern and equipped kitchen, and a large enclosed back yard & garden. Also a full-size laundry room which is shared only with the apartment upstairs. This is a private home not an apartment house, and I put in the best of everything - granite counters in the kitchen, built-in microwave, gas stove, marble walls & pedestal sink in the bathroom, all bamboo hardwood floors, walk-in closet, etc. Furniture in photos belongs to my current tenant as they had their own, and will be replaced by mine currently stored. (If you have your own furniture I will lower the price.) I have a beautiful large collection of art and carpets - you may choose whatever strikes your fancy! All linens & kitchenware. You can choose from my fine art collection, carpets (if you have no pets), and other items. Or rent or bring in your own furnishings for a discount on the monthly rent. Available November 1 or thereafter as my current tenant of 3 years just moved out of the City last Saturday and I am redoing the interior - painting, refinishing beautiful wooden floors, gardens, etc. If you wish to commit for a shorter period, we can renegotiate the length of our agreement.
AMENITIES - The apartment opens directly onto an enormous all-enclosed garden & yard (perfect for pets), about the size of the house itself. No garage space because there is always plenty of street parking here, so we use it for storage, bikes, the laundry, etc. We have a forced air heating system but it hardly ever gets too hot or too cold.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD - is residential & ultra-safe, close to public transportation and plenty of street parking. Great coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping streets nearby (Noriega, Taraval, & Irving, from 9th to 32nd Avenues. We're across from Lincoln H.S., 3 short blocks from the new Lycee Francaise on 19th Ave, a short bus or bike ride to Stonestown Mall; SFSU, around the corner from a synagogue & a Lutheran church, and not far from the Alice Fong Chinese American public school. It's not far from UCSF (but public transportation to UC Med Center is less than direct). We're 2 short blocks from the jogging/dog-walking path around the 24th Ave reservoir which has a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean & GG Bridge, not far from the now-famous Moraga Mosaic Steps up to Grandview Park with 360* view of the entire city, and 8 blocks from Golden Gate Park, both of which are great for biking, jogging and pet walks.
MUNI & FREEWAYS - On the corner are both Muni buses 48 & 66, and the 19th Ave line is 3 short blocks away. Major streetcars are nearby (Taraval, Noriega, the N Judah) all not far from the West Portal terminal. Easy access to I-280 & 101 if you're driving south to the Peninsula, or north to Marin. It could be as little as 15 minutes to get to or from the Oakland Bay Bridge even during rush hour because Oak & Fell are one-way with staggered lights.
TERMS - 6-month renewable month-to-month lease. Shorter term can be negotiated, especially if you use your own or rented furniture.  No smokers, or big partying people. A lover of gardening will be especially happy because of the great garden in the back and another small one at the entrance. DSL/Broadband & cable TV are already installed, landline telephone line if you need it. We split utilities, which aren't much - barely $100 a month covers gas, electric, water, & trash. Cable &; internet are separate but you pay only half as it's shared with upstairs.
TO SEE APT - I'm having an Open House today, Saturday at 1 or tomorrow, Sunday morning, but please text me for the address, & with a time so we don't get bottled up since the contractor left equipment over the weekend. Texting my cell is better than calling or email. Although my tenant left the City she's happy to to talk with you, so you can ask her anything.

LOCATION:
The North Panhandle neighborhood has quickly become a household name in San Francisco, although it is better known as NoPa.
NoPa's borders surround mostly residential properties, but its key location is convenient to some of the city's most popular destination restaurants and a growing number of storefronts. The eastern border runs along Divisadero Street, which is fast-paced with foot-traffic energy, boutique and vintage shops, epicurean desirables, and organic grocers.
Residents who live in this neighborhood enjoy the amenity of not having to own an automobile to get around in the district and out to every corner of the city. Some longtime residents will also admit that they find little reason to leave the area, as all of the city's amenities are within reach.
The neighborhood's westernmost border opens right up into Golden Gate Park providing endless opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities. Across the Panhandle, the long southern border along Fell Street provides a direct route to the freeway for residents that work outside the city or need a quick getaway. Other neighboring districts offer proximity to the University of San Francisco as well as the main facility for Kaiser Permanente.
With a growing number of destination restaurants and storefronts igniting its soaring popularity, becoming a resident of the North Panhandle would be an honor in the eyes of many San Franciscans.

19626,"$3250 / 1br - 750ft2 - Beautiful, Large Garden Studio in Duboce Triangle ","QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
(This is really a studio, but is listed as a one-bedroom as it is larger than most one-bedrooms at 750 square feet).
This garden unit was constructed as new in 2000, and this is just the third time it's been vacant since. Sure, it's a studio, but it's big. About 750 square feet (or 70 square meters for you Europeans). It features a completely open layout, spanning the complete width of the 25-foot wide building. French doors lead out to the private rear yard.
Bullet points are easier, you say?
 -	Dramatic open layout
 -	Dishwasher
 -	Washer & dryer in the unit
 -	Garbage disposal
 -	Walk-in closet
 -	Extremely quiet
 -	Private backyard
 -	Ground floor flat in three-story building
 -	Overall immaculate condition
As for the neighborhood, this is Duboce Triangle. Those in the know just adore this little three-sided slice in the middle of the city. It has a small-neighborhood feeling despite being spitting distance from one of S.F.'s main transit arteries (Market Street). The MUNI subway line is 1.5 blocks away, the F streetcar line even closer (it is a dream commute to the financial district). BART is seven blocks away, as is freeway access. Most, if not all, Silicon Valley buses stop nearby. It's technically part of the Castro, though the Mission and Lower Haight are just a few blocks away. Cafes, shops, restaurants, nightlife, banks, Whole Foods, Safeway, and more are just steps away.
Some minor downsides...
 -	This unit offers street parking only. Parking here is nowhere near as bad as Russian Hill or North Beach. Street parking is easy during the day on weekdays. If you commute home from work each weeknight after 7pm, you might find it annoying.
 -	It is a ground floor unit, with large windows and doors facing north. Natural light consists of ambient light only.
 -	Sorry, no dogs, but possibly a cat.
I'll be showing the place by appointment only starting Monday, October 8th. Shoot me an email, preferably with some info about yourself.

Buena Vista/Ashbury Heights is a small community, and one of San Francisco's many neighborhoods built upon a steep hill providing breathtaking views of the city. It is close to all amenities in the Haight and to Golden Gate Park.
The neighborhood is light in commercial traffic, but heavy in green and residential space, with the entire area lined with large plantings of palm trees, lending it an attractive tropical character. The focus of the community circles around Buena Vista Park, the first official park in San Francisco established in 1867. The park is celebrated by its nearby residents and by all San Franciscans for its secluded, winding trails as well as for being home to one of the city's few remaining oak woodlands.
The homes that line the streets in this upscale neighborhood are a mix of the traditional Edwardian and Victorian single-family homes innate to San Francisco's character, with modern residences whose contemporary architects gracefully blended in their designs, a nod to the neighborhood's inherent style.
Its convenient location provides walking-distance proximity to a large handful of neighboring districts overflowing with boutiques, bars, restaurants, cafes, vintage clothing stores, home décor shops, and music venues. And with the city's public transit lines running through and around its borders, accessing other parts of the city is simple.
Buena Vista/Ashbury Heights is a notably beautiful neighborhood that embodies a very unique charm and offering an exclusive San Francisco experience.

ADDRESS: 1828 Pacific
A Taste of Versailles in San Francisco's Pacific Heights! Fabulously Restored 2BR/2BA Flat with 3 Fireplaces, 2 Living Rooms, Dining Room, Sauna and Parking Space!
Opulent Pacific Heights furnished flat is truly fit for royalty. Both the Queen Anne Victorian and flat have been painstakingly restored. The attention to detail in restoring the flat to its original condition has to be seen to be believed. From floor to ceiling, not an inch has been overlooked.
You are greeted at the entry and throughout the flat with beautiful, leaded stained glass windows. Inlaid Brazilian cherry wood parquet glows a deep, rich red. Separated by sliding wooden doors, three large, adjoining rooms front the flat, two living rooms and the dining room. A broad corridor with cabinets and side tables connects and complements them, and each room has its own ornate, distinctly unique fireplace. Wall colors and light fixtures are unique to each of these three rooms as well. The third room farthest from the entrance, the dining room, has a magnificent 10-seat dining table, Baroque inset credenza, cabinets, and trompe l'oeil wall design.
Both bedrooms face north and receive morning and evening sun. The master bedroom has a broad bay window and extensive wall closets. The master bath has both clawfoot tub and separate glass-enclosed shower. The second bedroom includes access to a balcony, and the second bath, with shower over tub, is just outside the bedroom's entrance.
Gourmet kitchen has top-of-the-line appliances, including a high-tech nine-burner gas stove, seated counter space on the four-side marble counter top, numerous cabinets and shelves, and leaded glass sliding doors which separate it from the flat's main corridor.
The flat has a second, lower level with both sauna and steam room. Lease includes one parking space in the building's garage.
Great location within 2-3 blocks of the heart of Polk Street's shopping and dining area, Lafayette Park, and many bus lines, including the 47 and 49 Van Ness, 1 California, 19 Polk and the California Street Cable Car. 5-6 blocks and you're close to the heart of Fillmore Street's great dining and shopping district, and the start of Union Street's. Both Walk and Transit Scores are 94.
Tenant pays a one-time broker's fee.

The Inner Mission is one of San Francisco's most vibrant neighborhoods. Homes in the neighborhood include grand, century-old houses, smaller Victorian cottages, and new condo developments that have sprung up in the past couple of years. 
Stroll along Valencia Street any evening, and you'll experience an urban planner's dream: thousands of young residents out for a bite to eat; a standing-room only crowd at the Make Out Room; tuning up their bikes at Freewheel Bike Shop; or checking out the latest avant-garde performance at Dance Mission Theater.
The neighborhood is home to dozens of restaurants serving numerous styles of cuisine, including many taquerias, for which the neighborhood has become famous. Dave Eggers' 826 Valencia foundation for kids offers writing workshops next to Paxton Gate, a store full of curiosities designed to spark anyone's imagination.
Access to public transportation is plentiful in the Mission. In addition to multiple bus lines there are two Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations at 16th Street and Mission Street and 24th Street and Mission Street.

Hello!
I am looking for someone to take over my studio lease from the mid of December (dates are flexible) till the 10th of July (and of course you can extend later). I have modern fully furnished studio on Mission Street of San - Francisco in a secure building. The studio is perfect for a single occupant or for a couple. Fully equipped kitchen includes stove, microwave, oven, toaster, blender, coffee machine, kettle, full set of cutleries and and dishes. Big bathroom with tub. Living space is separated from the ""bedroom"" so there will be enough privacy for 2 people. Walk - in closet with many hangers. The studio is up to 20th floor with a good inner garden view. The studio is facing south and I have lots of  natural lights (actually I never turn on light before 7.30 pm what helps a lot to save electricity).

Location:
Nob Hill is a definitive San Francisco neighborhood, home to history and a pedigree that continues to thrive today.
Within the borders of this high-class neighborhood are some of the most upscale restaurants, stately homes, and exclusive hotels; yet it is surrounded by a diverse group of neighborhoods that attract a variety of residents and visitors.
The homes in Nob Hill are well known for being grand, a direct reflection of a more sophisticated time. Residents here live in mostly single-family homes that are vintage Edwardian flats, but luxury high-rise condominiums also found here make it a popular neighborhood for both young couples and urban professionals.
Its unmistakably upscale reputation goes back more than one hundred years ago during the Gold Rush when it was home to many mansions built by railroad tycoons of the time in their attempt to escape the chaos on flatter grounds. In those locations today sit luxury hotels, including the famous Fairmont Hotel, as well as Grace Cathedral, revered as one of San Francisco's grandest churches.
The iconic cable car runs up Powell into the Nob Hill neighborhood taking tourists through the vibrant area. While similar in stature to neighbors like Russian Hill and Pacific Heights, the heights of Nob Hill seem to represent a climb up to the life of luxury, while surrounding districts such as the Financial District, Downtown, North Beach, and nearby Tenderloin each possess a completely unique and distinct character separate from Nob Hill.
Home to some of the most distinguished buildings and people of San Francisco, Nob Hill is a beloved neighborhood.

Beautifully remodeled large studio in a 1920's Spanish Revival Building in the Vista del Mar/Sutro Height Neighbor of the Outer Richmond has Spectacular Spanning Ocean Views.  On a clear day, you can see all the way down the coast line to Pedro Point, south of Pacifica.  This corner unit has a large kitchen with dishwasher, 5 burner range, microwave/hood/light, under-counter sink and under-cabinet lighting.  Must see it to really appreciate it.Built in 1925, El Prado is a Spanish revival beauty that boasts some of the most spectacular ocean views in the Lincoln Park area. The restored lobby entrance leads you to spacious units flooded with natural light from large floor to ceiling windows. Private entry room, large walk in closets, newly remodeled kitchens with separate dining area. This spacious studio features classic retro elegance, period fixtures and details with all the modern conveniences. And El Prado is a few blocks from so many things to do, especially if you like outdoors and the ocean. Trails to hike and bike just are just a short walk down to Lands End and Lincoln Parks. Play a few rounds at the Lincoln Park golf course, see the latest exhibit at the Legion of Honor. Of course, you can always take off your shoes down at the beach to walk along the shore and perhaps fly a kite. For your convenience, we provide an on-site laundry. We also feature indoor parking for an additional monthly rent, but we only have a limited number and they are currently occupied.",37.779705,-122.504057,richmond / seacliff,2018-10-04 08:43:45,2018-10-14 11:30:10,2400.0,False,600.0,0.0,1.0,cats,shared,garage,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco,richmond / seacliff

Comfort and Enjoyment  Located near the northeast corner of San Francisco, Nob Hill has some of the most beautiful architecture in the city. The neighborhood was built on one of the city's 44 hills, affording its residents breathtaking views of the San Francisco Bay and Marin County, as well as Alcatraz and the Marina District. Nob Hill can be found due north of the Union Square shopping district and Market Street, and also borders on Chinatown and the Financial District. Originally called California Hill, after the street that climbs up the hill's eastern face, it was renamed Nob Hill after the Central Pacific Railroad's ""Big Four,"" Leland Stratford, Collis Peter Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker, called The Nobs, built mansions there. This area still retains many of these qualities, from beautiful parks to perfectly preserved homes and churches. Today, a wealthy urban professional population rubs shoulders with some of the city's oldest families here.  Call Now:  show contact info

Large, sunny bedroom with great walk in closet open in our apartment on Lake, near Presidio and Laurel Heights! One of the roommates bought a home and is leaving after several years in this spot.
About the apartment:
We're on the top floor of a three story building so not only is it quiet, but we also get lots of natural light. Our street is quiet and safe, and we're just two blocks from the shops and cafes on Clement, which also has a great Sunday Farmer's Market. It's an easy commute downtown by several express buses, as well as other places throughout the city. We're also right by the Presidio and a few blocks from Golden Gate Park. There's always somewhere nearby to eat, hike or hang out! Apartment is strictly non-smoking. 
- Washer and dryer in unit
- Garbage disposal and dishwasher
- 3 bedrooms, 1.5 bathrooms
- Bright & large living room with large television 
- Large, sunny, formal dining room that's great for hosting friends or working from home
- Hardwood floors throughout
- Several closets for storage
About you:
Lady, professional, mid-late 20's or early 30's, looking for a normal, low key living situation. We keep the shared spaces very clean and encourage baking, cooking and TV watching. 
About us: 
Two late 20 year old ladies - one works downtown in the beauty industry, the other works in the Presidio in television production. We are pretty low key during the week and on week nights, going to a workout class, meeting friends after work or hanging out at home and watching TV (Fixer Upper, Grey's, the Bachelor) with a glass of wine. We're often out and about on the weekends exploring the city, and while we sometimes have people over for dinners, we don't bring the party back late night. We've tried to make our apartment comfortable and homey, and hope you're looking for the same!
About the room:
Available November 1 ($1,988) and is large enough for a few pieces of furniture and Queen bed. There's a large walk-in closet and the room gets a lot of great, natural light.
Overall great-sized closets and ample storage throughout the unit!

Location:
The Ingleside neighborhood sits in the southwestern section of San Francisco and like its close neighbors, its grounds were originally home to horse racing, roadhouses, and farms. But once the area reached its full potential after the 1906 earthquake, Ingleside became a quiet residential haven that still attracts homebuyers today.
Most of the homes here were built before 1940 and cover a range of architectural styles, with a majority being small- to medium-sized single-family homes. Residents here enjoy quaint Victorian cottages, Mediterranean Revival, and stucco-coated townhomes, as well as Spanish-style abodes.
Ocean Avenue stretches across the entire northern border of Ingleside, serving as the primary commercial strip. What residents can not find here, they can find in nearby neighborhoods -- which along with all of San Francisco -- are accessible by the public transportation lines that access Ingleside.
Notable businesses along Ocean Avenue are the Ingleside Community Center, providing a safe place for youth to study and receive tutoring, as well as the newly remodeled and polished Ingleside Branch Library, and a long-time favorite watering hole, The Ave Bar.
Ingleside is considered one of the more affordable residential neighborhoods in San Francisco. With its location being an amenity itself, with easy proximity to all of the city's offerings, its popularity is bounding, making it an even more alluring destination for homebuyers and renters alike.

Come home to all new. This apartment has just been renovated to feature brand new wood flooring, new stone countertops, and new stainless steel appliances. These new finishes complement the stunning and timeless features we love in this home, including the floor to ceiling windows, high ceilings, and large glass sliding doors to let you onto your private patio.
This massive two bedroom has been converted into a three bedroom with the professional installation of a flex wall in the living room. By adding this wall, we have created a spacious third bedroom while still providing a large living space and open concept kitchen in the home. This wall comes complete with a locking door, and is strong enough to mount a television onto. Nowhere else in SOMA will you find a three bedroom home with this square footage and low price point.

INTRODUCTION: The ""Enchanted Garden Hideaway"" is a fully furnished private large one-bedroom suite with a separate entrance, located right in the heart of the picturesque Noe (No-ee) Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.  Built just above the garden level, this well-appointed stylish accommodation is perfect as temporary housing or an extended vacation rental (31 night minimum lease required). It is clean, secure, smoke-free and pet and eco-friendly. It's ideally suited for one to two persons. 
FLEXIBLE TERMS:  This is a perfect fully furnished space, especially if your are moving in or out of the city, remodeling your home, here for an extended stay for work, visiting family or on a nice long San Francisco vacation. We offer a 30-day lease - which is the required minimum stay - and then month to month thereafter (or prorated portion thereof.) That means if you plan on staying only 31, 32, 33 nights or more, we can accommodate you!
LOCATION: Nestled in the heart of Noe Valley of San Francisco, the ""Enchanted Garden Hideaway"" overlooks our charming garden and surrounding the attractive neighborhood. Noe Valley is also blessed as having one of the sunniest and warmest neighborhoods in the city - an important consideration here in San Francisco.  And Noe Valley is known for its up-scale desirability and charm -- boasting trendy restaurants, bakeries, wine and cheese shops, fashionable apparel boutiques, floral shops and public transportation.  Other rentals like to say they are located near Noe, but the ""Enchanted Garden Hideaway"" is right in the middle of it.
SIZE and LAYOUT: Tucked away from the street noise, this space is a completely private one-bedroom apartment that's much bigger than most hotel suites. Descending one flight of stairs from the street level accesses it. It has an open and bright snack bar as well as a separate dining area. The smart-looking living area adjoins a private deck with a beautiful garden and neighborhood view. A large separate ensuite bedroom, sheltered from outside noise and sunlight, allows you to sleep-in as late as you like. It features an abundance of lighting, ceiling fans, a built-in granite desk, two walk-in closets and a private full size bath.
STYLISH FURNISHINGS:  A granite breakfast bar with bar stools, comfortable couch, coffee table, entertainment console with a wide-screen HDTV, dining set for four, two queen-size beds, a twin-size convertible bed, dresser and a built-in granite desk with an executive chair are tastefully arranged. Elegant, contemporary wall hangings and area rugs enhance the space's ambience.
PRIVATE DECK: You'll enjoy exclusive use of your own spacious wood deck featuring a beautiful view of the neighborhood and the garden below. You will find that this space can be a tranquil sanctuary in the middle of the bustling city.  Deck furniture includes a gas BBQ, chaise lounge and a patio bistro set.
BUSINESS AMENITIES: Secured high-speed wireless internet is included.  A shared laser printer/copier machine is also connected to the network. ""3G"" and ""4G"" cell phone reception is excellent.
ENTERTAINMENT: A 37"" flat-screen HDTV, equipped with cable box is installed in the living area. Local and premium cable channels plus many free on-demand programs and more are included. A second bedroom HDTV also features premium cable channels.  The bedroom is equipped with an I-pod compatible stereo alarm clock.
SEPARATE FULLY EQUIPPED SNACK BAR: New granite countertops, stainless steel sink with disposal, automatic dishwasher, refrigerator/freezer, coffee maker, blender, microwave and toaster are installed. Utensils, dishes, glassware, flatware are also provided. 
SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS: You'll have sweet dreams on either queen-sized memory-foam mattress with high thread-count cotton sheets.
PRIVATE BATH: Full size shower with glass enclosure is installed. A designer sink and commode as well as a large toiletry cabinet complete this elegant granite tiled bathroom. 
SEPARATE SHARED LAUNDRY ROOM: A modern washer/gas dryer, utility sink and iron with ironing board, are available for your use, free of charge.
MAID SERVICE:  Once a month maid service is provided by our professional cleaning staff, who will change the sheets and towels, vacuum, dust, polish the wood and glass surfaces and deep clean the kitchen and bathrooms for you.
TRANSIT and PARKING: We are just steps away from the Muni streetcars (J and F-lines) and busses (48-line), the Genentech and Google shuttle coaches and a ten minute walk to BART (24th St Station) and the 24 bus line.  This makes getting around town a breeze without a car. Street parking is also available.
LOCAL CONVENIENCES: A ""Whole Foods"" super-market is a five-minute walk away.  Additionally, a convenience store is within a baseball throw from the house, as is a dry cleaning/laundry business. Numerous banks and real-estate agencies are also close-by.
WALKING: We recommend exploring Noe Valley on foot (WalkScore of 97 out of 100; see ""Walker's Paradise""). Noe Valley is a safe, well-lit, police patrolled, up-scale neighborhood that is pedestrian friendly.  Loads of enchanting, eye-popping Victorian homes that escaped the fire of 1906 adorn the neighborhood.
FITNESS and BICYCLING:  Two local fitness clubs are right around the corner and   Castro's fully equipped two-story gym is a short streetcar ride away. Bicycle rentals are just down the street.  
PET-FRIENDLY:  Your quiet, friendly dog (under 60 pounds) or cat is welcomed here at the ""Enchanted Garden Hideaway.""  Large, lockable doggy doors lead to the backyard for safe 24/7 pet relief and we will take care of any backyard clean up. (Backyard is restricted to pets only.) 
ECO-FRIENDLY: The building is equipped with roof-top electric solar panels, renewable bamboo wood floors and ipe wood decks, environmentally friendly insulation, energy conserving light bulbs, motion activated switches, energy-saving appliances, water-conserving toilets and shower heads, a new large-capacity gas-saving water heater and a new high-efficiency central-air heater with a smart thermostat.",37.751705,-122.42743700000001,noe valley,2018-10-04 11:06:19,2018-10-11 20:36:38,4399.0,False,800.0,1.0,1.0,both,shared,none,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco,noe valley

Available for sublease is a 750sf Junior One Bedroom apt in the NEMA building in SOMA. Unit is available till March 31st 2019 with the option to extend. I've lived at NEMA for a year and a half and loved the building to bits as it has all I could want in a community building. Great amenities, staff, technology, events and neighbors.
I have to leave the city for an extended period and would like to retain my lease by subletting the unit to someone that can appreciate and enjoy it in the meanwhile. I expect to be away for about 6-9 months but you'd only be obligated to 5 months (till end of March) with the option to extend should you wish to.
This building is perfect for employees of Uber (same block), Square (same block), Twitter (across the street) to name a few among many others within walking distance. There are plenty of their employees within the building too so you will be in good company to network and or collaborate.
The sublease length is negotiable as I understand everyone may have different circumstances and thus am open to mutually viable options. The unit is generally available unfurnished, however if you're interested in the furnishing as is you are welcome to purchase it from me (at fair market value) or you can rent it for the duration of your stay. I will be selling all furniture I can easily replace or too cumbersome to move with so feel free to request a link to my listings should you be interested.

Short walk to USF, Golden Gate Park and Clement Street shops and restaurants.
This sunny 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom unit, with a large living room that can be used as third bedroom, is on the second floor of a well maintained three floor building and was recently vacated by three USF students (students usually use the large living room as a third bedroom so that each roommate will have their own room). The unit has new paint and was re-modeled two years ago with new wall to wall carpets throughout the apartment, new granite counter tops and kitchen area, new electric range, new refrigerator, new stainless steel sink, and new range hood. The unit also has a large closet in addition to smaller closets.
This unit is rent controlled.
The unit has double paned windows and is located at the front of the building for maximum sunshine. It also features an extra large living room (see the pic). One of the bedrooms has a large closet, see pic. 
The building is a short walk to USF and thus we do have some USF students residing in the building, but no wild parties and no pets. No smoking. The owners pays for garbage and water.  The depositi is 1 and 1/2 times the monthly rent. The unit is available for immediate move in.

Description
  
    This is a beautiful remodeled one bedroom apartment.  Everything was gutted and completely replaced - new walls, wiring, cabinets, bathroom, etc. The building is located on the corner of Jackson and Taylor streets in the prime part of upper Nob Hill and only one block south of Russian Hill.  It is ideal for walking to work, and only 5 blocks to North Beach.
I have owned the building for about 20 years during which time I have totally remodeled almost everything, including most of the apartments, all of the common areas including the basement, etc.  There have been very substantial upgrades for seismic safety, restoration of beautiful original plaster molding, restoration of hardwood floors in the entry, new lighting, etc.
The unit for rent is on the second floor of the building.  The kitchen is completely new with all new appliances, granite tops, pear laminate cabinets and a very nice new floor.  There are disposal, dishwasher, refrigerator, built in microwave and gas range.  Everything is relatively new.
The bathroom is also totally new as well.  The tile extends to the ceiling.  There is a large wall mirror.  All of the plumbing has been upgraded with new drains and copper water supply pipes.  All of the fixtures in the bathrooms are new.
The unit has hardwood floors, double glazed new windows and energy efficient lighting throughout.  All of the walls are fully insulated to reduce your heating costs and make the unit more comfortable.  All of the wiring throughout the unit is new and there are tons of electric plugs everywhere.
I have a relatively new laundry in the basement which has two energy and water efficient Neptune (Maytag) washers and two Neptune driers. The basement is quite an attractive part of the building, unlike most others in San Francisco.
I have one parking spot available for $350 per month. I also have one other view unit in the same building that is priced at $3,095. That unit has stainless appliances and is very nice.
I do not accept pets or smokers.  Sorry.
Best way to get in touch with me is to call my mobile phone or email me. 
Thanks for your interest.

20946,$2900 / 500ft2 - Noe Valley Furnished Studio with Full Kitchen & In-Unit Washer Dryer ,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Furnished, clean and well-equipped studio apartment with en suite washer and dryer, full kitchen, and a lovely front patio and backyard garden.  We're walking distance from the city's light rail and regional train lines, as well as some of the best shopping, night life, architecture, and neighborhood feel.  
*** 31 Day Minimum Stay ***
The main room includes the bedroom with Queen size bed, writing desk, fold-out sofa, sitting chair, 2 closets, and dining bar with two seats.  The main room is open to the fully equipped kitchen (stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, coffee maker, French press, coffee grinder, microwave). The TV is a Samsung flat screen with cable TV channels and a nice DVD library.  
Down the hallway you'll find the spacious bath with linens provided (remodeled in March 2018), and further down the hallway, there is a laundry room with additional storage.  Yes,  the washer and dryer is just for you.  
The front garden has a bistro table and chairs.  The backyard has a big patio and a garden and table and chairs and hammock.  Perfect for relaxing outside and enjoying the sunshine or the starry nights.
We include maid service about every 2 weeks, or twice per month.  So if you stay for 1 month, the rate includes the maid service before your arrival, as well as half-way through your stay.
The apartment has been thoughtfully furnished with the big things, as well as the little things you might need ... hair dryer, shampoo & soap, laundry detergent, dish soap and dishwasher detergent, umbrellas, iron, ironing board.
We're near 27th and Dolores/Guerrero, at the intersection of three fantastic neighborhoods ... the Mission, Bernal Heights, and Noe Valley.  
Grocery Stores:  The 24-Hour Safeway on Mission St is a 5 minute-walk away, and the Whole Foods on 24th St is a 15-minute walk. The Valencia Market and 26th & Guerrero Market are both on the way home from the BART station.  
It's an easy (very flat) walk from our apartment to 24th St Mission BART or the J-Church to get downtown for cable cars, museums, Chinatown, Union Square, and everything our fair city is known for.    And yes, we are a short walk to the tech shuttle stops.
PRICING
If staying for 6-month lease, the rent is $2900 per month, which includes the maid service every 2 weeks.
If not signing a 6-month lease, then the rent is $3300 per month.
Above includes $250-$375 per month we pay for maid service, as well as $300 per month you'd have to pay in water, electric, gas, trash pickup, cable TV, internet, and phone, at some other place.  So when you subtract those things out, which we are paying for you, that's less than $2400 per month in rent on the 6-month lease.  And when you consider how nicely the place is furnished, from the pots and pans and dishes, down to fresh linens and towels, which you'd otherwise have to buy  ... you've got a pretty awesome deal here.",37.747033,-122.42468999999998,noe valley,2018-10-07 16:50:23,2018-10-11 00:05:17,2900.0,False,500.0,0.0,1.0,none,in-unit,street,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco,noe valley

Up for grabs: one unfurnished room in a beautiful 2 bedroom apt, located steps away from the Marina Green. It's got water and park views from the bedroom and is ready for move in now!
The location is the perfect balance of quiet, but centrally located 7 mins walking from Chestnut St, Fort Mason, the Palace of Fine Arts, and more. The unit is very well laid out, with fantastic space optimization, good natural light, great water pressure, and a rooftop deck overlooking the bridge. It has a small dishwasher, on-site laundry, and while the oven looks old it is amazing. Parking is very very easy. Spaces are typically abundant within the block.
Prefer a roommate on a 6 month lease, with month to month after that and 30 days notice. Open to proposed alternatives (longer or shorter).
Me: 30 y/o, I work in tech, like EDM (but don't bring the party back), hiking, and hang gliding. I have a very well behaved 10 year old Golden retriever who is with me most all of the time. I won't expect a roommate to take care of him, but someone who likes dogs is a plus. I'm reasonably clean, and a good roommate. Hoping for same with a stable job who is also respectful of the space.

I'm having an Open House this morning as the owner of a 1 bed 1 bath (under-market, meaning, ""reasonably-priced""), newly built apartment in the Sunset. My tenant of three years moved out of the city but it can be viewed this weekend even though I'm repainting, reflooring, etc. You must TEXT me, Martin, at  show contact info
 for an appointment to view even during the morning's Open House. I will delete this posting as soon as it is rented. 
THE APARTMENT -  Newly built, almost 1000 sq ft, on the ground floor of my 2-story house: a full-size bedroom and bath, a full-size living room; a dining area; a small office or den/study (see photo for uses).  There's a fully-modern and equipped kitchen, an ""extra computer"" nook, and a very very large fully-enclosed back yard & garden. Full-size laundry room w almost-new w/d, shared only with the apartment upstairs. This is a private home not an apartment house, and I put in the best of everything - imported granite counters in the kitchen, custom cabinets, built-in microwave, gas stove, marble walls & a pedestal sink in the bathroom, all bamboo hardwood floors, walk-in closet in bedroom, etc. I am prepared to lend a new tenant some of my contemporary art collection (and if you don't have pets, some carpets, too) which are in nearby storage.  Available November 1 or a few days sooner if necessary, as my contractor is redoing the apartment with new colors, refinishing beautiful wood floors, etc.  I also have a landscaper working on the front and back gardens.
AMENITIES - The apartment opens directly onto an enormous garden & yard about the size of the house itself (fully-enclosed so perfect for pets which is why I put in a doggy door from the living room). No garage space because there is always plenty of street parking here, so we use it for storage, bikes, the laundry, etc. We have a forced air heating system but it hardly ever gets too hot or too cold. The furniture you see in some of the photos belonged to my tenant who just moved. I added them to show how they used some of the space.  (If you need the apartment fully-furnished, I have my own good furniture, great art for the walls, fine carpets, kitchenware & linens so I can furnish it completely for an additional cost.)  In the photos I also included places in the neighborhood listed in the next paragraph so if you're from out-of-town you'll see why people leave their hearts in this city.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD - is quiet, residential & ultra-safe, close to public transportation and plenty of street parking. Great coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping streets nearby (Noriega, Taraval, & Irving, from 9th to 32nd Avenues. Lincoln H.S. Is on the corner, we're 3 short blocks from the new Lycee Francaise on 19th Ave, a short bus or bike ride to Stonestown Mall & SFSU, a synagogue & a Lutheran church are around the corner, and we're not too far from St. Ignatius & a major Catholic church and the Alice Fong Chinese-American Public School. UCSF is also not far (but public transportation to UC Med Center is less than direct so plan to bike if you work there). We're 2 short blocks from the jogging/dog-walking path around the 24th Ave Reservoir which has a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean (see photo) & GG Bridge, not far from the now-famous Moraga Mosaic Steps up to Grandview Park with 360* view of the entire city, and 8 blocks from Golden Gate Park, both of which are great for biking, jogging and pet walks.
MUNI & FREEWAYS - Right on the corner are both Muni buses 48 & 66, and the 19th Ave line is 3 short blocks away. Major streetcars are nearby (Taraval, Noriega, the N Judah) all not far from the newly redone West Portal streetcar terminal that has four lines going Downtown or to the Zoo (like one every minute!), as well as to BART for the East Bay. Easy access to I-280 & 101 if you're driving south to the Peninsula, or north to Marin. It could be as little as 15 minutes to drive to SFO, or to the Oakland Bay Bridge even during rush hour because Oak & Fell are one-way with staggered lights.
TERMS - One-year renewable lease. (If you need a shorter period, or even furnishings, because you're moving temporarily or will be looking to buy a home in SF, we can talk.)  I don't mind using June 1st as an annual renewal date even for a permanent tenant. No smoking anywhere in the building, and no big partying people. Someone who loves gardening will score points because of the great garden in the back and another small one at the entrance, but having a green thumb or the time to garden is not a requirement to becoming my tenant). DSL/Broadband & cable TV are already installed, landline telephone line if you need it. We share utilities, which aren't much - barely $100 a month which covers gas, electric, water, & trash. Cable & internet are separate but you pay only half as it's shared with upstairs.
TO SEE APT - If you want to come please text me  show contact info
 for an appointment even for the Open House today (Sunday) b/c I have a different event I'm responsible for all afternoon. I'm also available during the week.  Texting my cell is better than calling b/c I'm hearing impaired; and emailing is not great either b/c my Inbox is overwhelming. I can deal with both if you can't text.  I had great tenants there for three years who left SF but they're happy to to talk with you, so you can call and ask them anything.  And please, try to see beyond the equipment my contractor left while sanding the floors, etc. We're  doing a lot to make the apartment a great home for someone!

NEIGHBORHOOD:
South of Market is a huge district, sprawling from the Embarcadero to Eleventh Street, between Market and Townsend. The neighborhood is a patchwork of warehouses, swanky nightspots, residential hotels, art spaces, loft apartments, furniture showrooms and the tenacious Internet companies.
The area around Market and Third Street is more well heeled, influenced by the nearby Financial District and conventions at the Moscone Center. Several of the city's arts organizations are located here, including the SF MOMA, the Center for the Arts at Yerba Gardens and the California Historical Society. It has a bohemian undercurrent, with the museums, several independent bookstores, the line of artsy clubbers waiting to get into the gallery and club 111 Minna, and students from the Academy of Art slouching around the Utrecht art supply store on New Montgomery.

INTRODUCTION: The ""City View Apartment"" is a fully furnished private large one-bedroom suite with a separate entrance, located right in the heart of picturesque the Noe (No-ee) Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.  Overlooking the city by the bay, this well-appointed stylish accommodation is perfect as temporary housing or an extended vacation (31 night minimum lease required). It is clean, secure, smoke-free and pet and eco-friendly and it's ideally suited for one to two persons. 
FLEXIBLE TERMS:  This is a perfect fully furnished space, especially if your are moving in or out of the city, remodeling your home, here for an extended stay for work, visiting family or on a nice long San Francisco vacation. We offer a 30-day lease - which is the required minimum stay - and then month to month thereafter (or prorated portion thereof.) That means if you plan on staying only 31, 32, 33 nights or more, we can accommodate you!
LOCATION: Nestled in the heart of Noe Valley of San Francisco, the ""City View Apartment"" is uniquely perched overlooking the city and the bay, but without having to climb any hills to get to the house. Noe Valley is also blessed as having one of the sunniest and warmest neighborhoods in the city - an important consideration here in San Francisco  and Noe Valley is known for its up-scale desirability and charm, boasting trendy restaurants, bakeries, wine and cheese shops, fashionable apparel boutiques, floral shops and public transportation.  Other rentals like to say they are located near Noe, but the ""City View Apartment"" is right in the middle of it.
SIZE and LAYOUT: Tucked away from the street noise, this one-bedroom apartment is about the size of a hotel suite. Its open kitchen and bright living area adjoins a large private deck with outstanding panoramic views. A separate bedroom adjoins the living area. It has a private full size bath and there are no stairs to climb.
STYLISH FURNISHINGS:  A breakfast bar with bar stools, twin lounge chairs, coffee table, entertainment console with a wide-screen HDTV, queen-size bed with nightstands, dresser and work desk and chair are tastefully arranged. Elegant, contemporary wall hangings and area rugs enhance the space's ambience.
PRIVATE DECK: You'll enjoy exclusive use of your own spacious wood deck with panoramic views of the city, the bay and the neighborhood gardens below. You will find that this space can be a tranquil sanctuary in the middle of the bustling city.  Deck furniture includes a gas BBQ, chaise lounge and a patio bistro set.
BUSINESS AMENITIES: Secured high-speed wireless internet is included.  A shared laser printer/copier is also connected to the network. ""3G"" and ""4G"" cell phone reception is excellent.
ENTERTAINMENT: A 42"" flat-screen HDTV, equipped with cable box is installed in the living area. Local and premium cable channels plus many free on-demand programs and more are available. The bedroom is equipped with an I-pod compatible stereo alarm clock.
NICELY EQUIPPED MODERN KITCHEN: Granite countertops, sink with disposal, dishwasher, refrigerator/freezer, coffee maker, microwave, gas range and toaster-oven are installed. Kitchen utensils, dishes, glassware, flatware and cookware also provided. Just right for breakfast in the morning or an evening snack. 
SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS: You'll have sweet dreams on the queen-sized Premium memory foam mattress. All linens are high thread-count cotton sheets.
PRIVATE BATH: Full size tub/shower with glass enclosure is installed. All cotton bath towels, are provided.
SEPARATE SHARED LAUNDRY ROOM: A modern washer/gas dryer, utility sink and iron with ironing board are available for your use, free of charge.
MAID SERVICE:  Once a month maid service is provided by our professional cleaning staff, who will change the sheets and towels, vacuum, dust, polish the wood and glass surfaces and deep clean the kitchen and bathrooms for you.
TRANSIT and PARKING: We are just steps away from the Muni streetcars (J and F-lines) and busses (48-line), the Genentech and Google shuttle coaches and a ten minute walk to BART (24th St Station) and the 24 bus line.  This makes getting around town a breeze without a car. Street parking is also available.
LOCAL CONVENIENCES: A ""Whole Foods"" super-market is a five-minute walk away.  Additionally, a convenience store is within a baseball throw from the house, as is a dry cleaning/laundry business. Numerous banks and real-estate agencies are also close-by.
WALKING: We recommend exploring Noe Valley on foot (WalkScore of 97 out of 100; see ""Walker's Paradise""). Noe Valley is a safe, well-lit, police patrolled, up-scale neighborhood that is pedestrian friendly.  Loads of enchanting, eye-popping Victorian homes that escaped the fire of 1906 adorn the neighborhood.
FITNESS and BICYCLING:  Two local fitness clubs are right around the corner and   Castro's fully equipped two-story gym is a short streetcar ride away. Bicycle rentals are just down the street.  
PET-FRIENDLY:  Your quiet, friendly dog (under 60 pounds) or cat is welcomed here at the ""City View Suite.""  Large, lockable doggy doors lead to the backyard for safe 24/7 pet relief and we will take care of any backyard clean up. (Backyard is restricted to pets only.)
ECO-FRIENDLY: The building is equipped with roof-top electric solar panels, renewable bamboo wood floors and ipe wood decks, environmentally friendly insulation, energy conserving light bulbs, motion activated switches, energy-saving appliances, water-conserving toilets and shower heads, a new large-capacity gas-saving water heater and a new high-efficiency central-air heater with a smart thermostat.",37.751705,-122.42743700000001,noe valley,2018-10-04 11:24:36,2018-10-11 20:35:07,4399.0,False,500.0,1.0,1.0,both,shared,street,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco,noe valley

Large windows in each of the two-, three- and four-bedroom configurations provide generous natural light and - in some cases - Pacific Ocean views that rival those of neighboring Sea Cliff. Though the standard foghorn soundtrack might say otherwise, sunsets here are more often fiery oranges and reds than shades of gray.Outside, native plants and grasses share space with organic community gardens, neighborhood gathering spaces, bike racks, and playgrounds. Nearby stops for the PresidiGo Shuttle make for easy access to the Presidio's Main Post and the free shuttle to downtown San Francisco.Get to Know the Presidio

Cozy cafes and local-favorite watering holes round out this reserved neighborhood's cordial repertoire. This is the best neighborhood with a myriad of coffee shops, restaurants, pubs and meeting places. 

 It is moments away from San Francisco landmarks: Union Square, The Financial District, The Ferry Building, North Beach, China Town and much more. The neighborhood has everything you need from North beach restaurants to a 12 min walk to Safeway,Trader Joe's, 24 HR fitness and 2 Blocks from 30 bus that runs right into the financial district. 


 Centrally located, the home is situated 4 blocks from Cable Car Museum and 6 blocks away from Grace Cathedral and Mark Hopkins.  With Powell Street BART station only a short walk through Lower Nob Hill and Union Square and several MUNI connections, all of San Francisco is at your fingertips.

This beautiful, newly remodeled duplex sits on an extremely quiet, tree-lined block, steps away from the Marina Green and Crissy Field.  The property affords the quintessential San Francisco lifestyle, due to its location in the Marina district and its proximity to the City's most desirable outdoor spaces and Chestnut Street.
The interior space is brand new and it benefits from a top to bottom remodel. The level of quality and refinement is clear from the moment one walks into the entry foyer, and is consistent throughout the entire interior space. Calming, neutral tones were used in the general color palette and a timeless, classically elegant design aesthetic is seen throughout every room.  
The Master Suite encompasses the entire 3rd floor of the property and it enjoys virtually unobstructed views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.    Spanning almost 1,000 square feet, the master suite creates an opulent, relaxing atmosphere throughout.   Rarely do properties of this caliber come onto the rental market, so act quickly.

21166,$1350 / 3br - Private bedroom + bathroom in 3BD/2BA SOMA apt ,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Two of my roommates are moving out in November, so I'm looking for a couple new ones to replace them.
About the apartment:
It's a 3BD/2BA place around 8th and Howard, pretty close to public transit and a grocery store. There's a washer / dryer as well as additional storage in the basement, and the apartment has central heat, a patio out back, and standard stuff like a dishwasher, garbage disposal, etc. The common areas are furnished, but the rooms themselves will not be.
About the rooms for rent:
1) The master suite ($1350) -- has its own attached bathroom and is by the back of the apartment.
2) Large room with bay windows ($1350) -- huge room with lots of light, shares a bathroom with my room but you could effectively consider it a private bathroom since I'll rarely be around (typically only a few weeks each year)
About me:
I'm a guy in my late twenties working as a software engineer at a startup downtown. I'm pretty laid back overall and enjoy hanging out with friends, exploring new restaurants (and boba shops), playing tennis, and playing board games. You probably won't see me much around the apartment since I usually live at my girlfriend's place (so I'll only be around for a few weeks each year).
About you:
I'm looking for a working professional who's clean, considerate, a non-smoker, and isn't looking to throw huge parties all the time. No gender preference, but I would prefer someone who's somewhat closer in age to me (20s-30s).
Logistics:
The monthly rent for either room would be $1350 + utilities (typically ~$50/month for electricity, water, trash, and internet), and the security deposit is $1100. No pets please, and preferably no couples either, though we could potentially work something out with rent. Move-in date November 1.
If you made it this far and you're interested in the room, please send me an email with a little bit about yourself and your FB / LinkedIn profile, and we can set up a time for you to take a look at the place. Please include the text [Sumner] in your email subject so it's easier for me to filter.

***This is a real apartment available for rent. Not a scam. We own the apartment and the whole building. Looking for nice tenants. We can meet and show you the apartment.  It has come to my attention that some scammer has been copying my ads.  Please make sure you are dealing directly with me.  I never rent to someone that I haven't met or spoken with over the phone / skype.  If you aren't in the city, then let me know if you have someone local that I can meet.  The security deposit and first month's rent is due on the first day of the lease.  Anyone asking for large sums of money up front from you is probably a scammer.  Please be aware.***

Looking for an apartment in the bay area can be very difficult. Especially with a busy work schedule, or if you're not currently in the area...
I'm a licensed real estate agent who offers a customized relocation service. I often describe it as hiring your own personal assistant who is dedicated to finding an apartment. I can take over the search completely. I'm very proactive. I preview listings, make videos, and can set up organized tours of San Francisco. If you can't make it to SF I can handle everything, and have a place waiting for you when you arrive. Good communication is key. I know the city very well and I love to place people where they will be happy. I've helped with everything from studio apartments to 10K plus homes.
When I lived in LA this business was my main focus. It was successful and I noticed a need for this kind of service. I have placed over 100 happy clients. Some of my clients were local professionals. Others were coming from other states/countries. Often NYC, because this type of service is standard there. Now I'm a buyers agent with Ackerman Realty in SF (where I'm originally from) and things are going well. I've had a successful year in sales so far. However, I like to stay busy and it's always nice to establish side income- in a commission based field. Therefore I will be starting up my relocation business again.s
I will be accepting clients on a fairly selective basis. I can only take one or two relocation's per month at this point. My real estate sales work takes the rest of my time. I'm looking for people who really want or need my help. This service is not for everyone. The fee is $2000. A $1000 retainer fee is due upfront and none nonrefundable. This would be compensation for my time if your plans change. This happens rarely in my experience. Money upfront seems to attract a serious clientele. The additional $1000 is due at the time of your lease signing. I'm a customer service driven person with high standards. I only take on clients when I know I can provide a five star service.

Hi there! My partner and I have a three bedroom for rent at Irving and 48th by the beach. We have two options available:
$1850/month for one bedroom and a half of a room(bedroom size) to use as storage or office~ couples ok and welcomed! Parking space optional. 
Another option: Two separate bedrooms, one for $1200 and the other for $1100. The slightly smaller of the two does not have a closet. 
About us: We are a busy couple one in our late twenties and the other mid forties. I am a nursing student at USF and an EMT at Genentech. My partner works for a prestigious theater downtown. We have a small house trained white fluffy dog (3 years old) that is in our room when we are gone. Unlikely that another dog would work though a cat may. Our dog may want to play)
Our ideal roommates: Easy going, responsible and clean. Furniture is a plus as we are getting rid of a lot now and want to start fresh. Couples we would prefer to be in a committed long term relationship or students sharing a room would also be fine. Credit and background check will be done with the owners (who are super nice btw!) Must have references and the sooner you can move in the better! :)

21394,$4200 / 3br - 1000ft2 - SoMa fully renovated 3BR Gem. Next Open House oct 17 ,"QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
(NEXT OPEN HOUSE is Wed Oct 17 6-7pm. Current tenants are in the midst of moving this weekend, so no showings until vacant.)  
This flat is in a lovely five unit Romeo-style apartment building on a quiet street in SoMa, fully remodeled to the studs in 2016. It's a 3-bedroom, one bath flat, with open kitchen/sitting room with breakfast bar. 
All new electrical, plumbing, insulation, walls, fixtures, etc. Sleek, quiet, efficient electric heating in each bedroom with separate thermostats. Brand new and cool bathroom with waterfall sink and tons of bathroom storage. New oak hardwood floors (no, not that Pergo sh*t you see all the time -- actual hardwood installed by an old Italian guy!). Washer/Dryer in the unit. All new cabinetry, granite kitchen. Dishwasher, garbage disposal. 
Plenty of hallway and bedroom closet space.
I live next door, so there is not a management company that comes when they want, and I care about the quality of the tenants because I live next to you!
It's small square-footage-wise, and each of the bedrooms is about the same size, making it better suited to roommates than to a couple looking for a larger master bedroom. But it's on Natoma between 7th & 8th in the heart of SoMa, 1.5 blocks from Civic Center BART/Muni, around the corner from hot restaurants, a block or two from SoMa clubs and nightlife, walkable to Metreon, City Hall, BART, CalTrain. All the tech company shuttle buses pass right by at 7th and Mission. On Street Parking, but walkable to Twitter, Zinga, Uber, Facebook, Google. 
Asking $4200. That's only $1400 a room, so a very good deal in SoMa.  Address is 618 Natoma Street #2, near 7th.  Available Oct 16. Email reply above or text  show contact info

Location:
Every neighborhood in San Francisco has its own unique characteristics that set it apart from the rest of the city, while at the same time exuding an undertone that clearly denotes its San Francisco residency. The Inner Sunset is a perfect example, bubbling with diversity with a beat in-line with big city living.
Boasted as one of the most beloved neighborhoods by San Franciscans, the Inner Sunset has a laid-back, small-town feel with a funky edge that keeps the neighborhood fresh. Home to a widely diverse mix of people, the local businesses have no problem keeping up with the latest in cuisine and retail selections.
Its northern edge heads right into Golden Gate Park, a nicety that can quickly clog up any parking privileges privy to residential districts, particularly during large events and weekends. The Inner Sunset is also home to UCSF that serves as both a school and medical facility, which keeps the neighborhood buzzing with grad students and visitors who flock to the medical facility for the most innovative and advanced medical services in the country.
A walk down any street in the neighborhood will make it clear that the residents all know one another, nodding and chatting as they gather at mom-and-pop diners, drug stores, shoe repair shops, and small grocers on their daily outings.
The Inner Sunset may be one of the foggiest districts in all of San Francisco, but it doesn't seem to deter the locals from gathering in this warm-hearted and trendy borough.

Beautiful and incredibly spacious 1 bedroom apartment in a original Pacific Heights Victorian building with approx. 11 foot ceilings and abundant period detailing. Newly redone kitchen with stainless steel appliances and new gas range installed after pictures were taken.  Bathroom with double vanity, shower over tub ample storage. Newly refinished authentic hardwood floors and 2 decorative fireplaces (being painted, not reflected in pictures taken two days ago). Stacked washer and dryer in the unit. 24 hour security cameras as well as new doorbell-to-phone intercom system with code for packages. Bike rack, garden enclosed garbage, friendly tenants.
This is a large and luxurious apartment with a separate kitchen and massive open living room, perfect for large sectionals or deep couches and full dining spaces. Shared deck space on this level outside for morning coffee or evening glass of wine.
All of this in a friendly and very well cared for building with on-site management and pride of ownership. The building is newly painted inside and out and truly is in a central location, just blocks from Fillmore, Union, Polk and Chestnut. Lafayette Park is only two blocks away. The building has also undergone a full seismic retrofit with steel and concrete foundation, and sits on bedrock, for those who might be curious about the engineering!
For commuting, there are several close thoroughfares, from Broadway or California East/West to Franklin/Gough/Van Ness from North to South. Quick commute to financial district or Soma. 
Come experience this Pacific Heights gem! 
SFAA Contract will be used. Standard one year term. Standard security deposit of 1.5x rent but can be stretched out of over two installments if necessary. Please bring credentials and all interested parties so that a lease can be signed or the apartment secured.

FAQ:
Utilities: Tenant pays for PG&E and internet - owner pays for water, garbage, professional cleaning of common areas.
Pets: No additional deposit required for pets, but pets are evaluated on a case by case basis, and evidence of training or personality (references, propensity to bark, etc) is always helpful. This is generally a pet friendly building.

LOCATION:
The North Panhandle neighborhood has quickly become a household name in San Francisco, although it is better known as NoPa.
NoPa's borders surround mostly residential properties, but its key location is convenient to some of the city's most popular destination restaurants and a growing number of storefronts. The eastern border runs along Divisadero Street, which is fast-paced with foot-traffic energy, boutique and vintage shops, epicurean desirables, and organic grocers.
Residents who live in this neighborhood enjoy the amenity of not having to own an automobile to get around in the district and out to every corner of the city. Some longtime residents will also admit that they find little reason to leave the area, as all of the city's amenities are within reach.
The neighborhood's westernmost border opens right up into Golden Gate Park providing endless opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities. Across the Panhandle, the long southern border along Fell Street provides a direct route to the freeway for residents that work outside the city or need a quick getaway. Other neighboring districts offer proximity to the University of San Francisco as well as the main facility for Kaiser Permanente.
With a growing number of destination restaurants and storefronts igniting its soaring popularity, becoming a resident of the North Panhandle would be an honor in the eyes of many San Franciscans.

About the Neighborhood: 
Nestled between Nob Hill, Union Square, and the Tenderloin, Lower Nob Hill evokes both the elegance of Nob Hill and the hipness of the Tenderloin, and it is dotted with edgy art galleries and bohemian coffee shops. For foodies, hip eateries and casual cocktail lounges can be found on every block.  Gourmet groceries can be found a block away at Sutter Fine Foods, and Heart of the City Farmers Market is a twice weekly event, located nearby. Minutes from Union Square and the Financial District, Lower Nob Hill is a commuters dream, from the iconic California Street Cable Car, to cross town Muni buses, and Civic Center BART and Metro station.

Nob Hill can be found due north of the Union Square shopping district and Market Street, and also borders on Chinatown and the Financial District. Originally called California Hill, after the street that climbs up the hill's eastern face, it was renamed Nob Hill after the Central Pacific Railroad's ""Big Four,"" Leland Stratford, Collis Peter Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker, called The Nobs, built mansions there.

Two Bedroom Apartment within Mission District 
 | 3875 18th St #11 San Francisco, CA 94110
Much like its famed burrito, the Mission District has a lot of layers. Latin tradition, tech innovation, art and culinary scenes combine to create a one-of-a-kind atmosphere. Absorb the artistic ambiance at City Art Gallery, get into the global groove at Bissap Baobab, or take dinner and a movie to a whole new dimension at Foreign Cinema -- the Mission is a multi-course cultural menu. Bart, MUNI and tech shuttles make the Mission the ideal launch pad.

Because while Potrero Hill is a neighborhood packed with every convenience and cuisine, it is, first and foremost, a neighborhood. Families and professionals, young couples and old, third-generation homeowners and first-time buyers, all sharing one thing in common: a home on the Hill. This quickly developing area near the San Francisco Design Center and the new UCSF campus. You are enjoys easy access to Mission Bay and downtown, or in the other direction, 16th Street BART and the famously hip Valencia corridor. You're also just 3 blocks from the 18th Street commercial strip that gives Potrero Hill that ""oasis in the urban jungle"" feel. You couldn't marry the urban, industrial, and neighborhood feel of San Francisco any better than in Potrero Hill. With several main bus lines and proximity to the freeways, the Third Street light rail, and Caltrain, this is the perfect commuter location.
Neighborhood Features:
Conveniently located with easy freeway access to the I-280 and the I-101

This large one bedroom unit has lots of light, hardwood floors and a porch swing for Summer warm days. This building has an older style layout, as it was probably built in the 1870's and somehow survived the earthquake and fire in 1906. It does have all the modern conveniences of a kitchen and laundry room in the unit. There are large skylights which flood the kitchen with light and a back porch for growing orchids.
